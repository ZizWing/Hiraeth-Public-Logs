Reflection
==========
## Last week

1. What went well last week and to which extent have the planned results been achieved?
> My personal tasks integrated smoothly and I could continue working on my tasks without much trouble compared to the previous sprint. The new rules dictating the file structure and such have definitely helped me here.

> Bugfixing on friday went by fast and in general created a unique atmosphere where everyone was working together to collectively fix anything and everything that went wrong from the thursday before. My personal contributions get washed away a bit here since this all happened so fast, but it comes down to taking up bugfix tasks when they appear and communicating their status with my team lead directly. This ensured a minimal communication overhead and made sure it was clear what the state of each fix was at what point in time. The lead could then communicate this info to relevant teammembers or other teams if needed.

2. What did not go well, what annoyed you and what shouldn't happen again?
> What went horrible was the integration before "terrible thursday". There were issues with the player which caused pretty much all the systems to break at least partially, if not fully. The problem here is that this was out of my control for the most part. It's a part of the game created by others that some of my (and other's) code depends on. To reduce the impact of such failures, we should have communicated our progress between teams more often so we could have taken this into account beforehand. My personal suggestion (which was in line with that of many others) was to call a feature freeze earlier before a deadline. In this case we had set it up as such that the day before the deadline was the final day to integrate any features. This deadline was missed by the player team and thus extended to the day of the deadline under the assumption it was ready for integration. It turned out it wasn't and we should not have allowed it to be integrated anymore.

3. What will you improve next time?
> In future projects I will vouch for strict rules surrounding deadlines in order to prevent major integrations issues as described above. This may limit the amount we can show in demos/presentations, but it ensures that whatever we show is as stable as it can be and that there is at least something to show in the first place. Besides that a dedicated group of playtesters should be assigned to play (parts of) the game at least a day before the deadline so that critical bugs can be found and hopefully fixed before any demo or presentation.

> I will also need to start testing integrated features earlier in the sprint to prevent last-minute issues from popping up, or at the very least being able to reduce the impact of these bugs. If features that I rely on are not implemented close to a deadline, I need to take more direct action and communicate about the status of said features so I can make adjustments before the deadline if needed.
