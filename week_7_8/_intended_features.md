Intended Features
==================

## List of Features
- Making the bridge in Level 2 collapse when a Bleddyn walks over it.
- Adding occlusion culling back into all areas.
- Increasing framerate through performance optimizations.

## Planned tasks
- Implementing a breakable bridge model.
- Collapsing the bridge with physics.
- Trigger the collapse on Bleddyn entry.
- Research about relevant optimizations (based on what profiling brings up).
- Profiling development builds of the game.
- Prototyping potential optimizations.
