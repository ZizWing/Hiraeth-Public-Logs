Intended Fixes
===============

## List of Fixes
Not a whole lot planned for me specifically this week. I need to implement the bridge collapse and after that I will focus on performance improvements. It's difficult to say what fixes I will work on. Whenever I get the time to do so I will do it on request (more or less).

## Planned tasks
Nothing as of the start of week 7. This will dynamically change over the course of this week so this section will be empty. Any fixes performed will be listed in the achieved fixes of this week.
