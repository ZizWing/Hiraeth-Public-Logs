# Hiraeth-Public-Logs
Public-facing variant of my personal contributions to the Hiraeth project to allow referencing them.

The most relevant stuff is located in each week's "achieved_result_n.md" or "achieved_features.md" file, depending on the week of the project.
Note that this is not entirely consistent due to the way the project was set up.
The way I log things here is according to the template I was told to use.

This repo only contains the records of what I did and not the actual code of anything since I do not have the rights to make that publicly available.
If needed, I can show code during interviews, but I cannot grant access to the private repo hosting the sourcecode, nor can I make it public.
As such, any links to this repo will not work.
