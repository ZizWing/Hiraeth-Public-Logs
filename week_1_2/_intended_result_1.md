Intended result 1 - Editor- and scene-specific code execution
==================

## Description of the result
Running (parts of) code only while in the unity editor and in a specific scene for easy manual debugging of yet-to-be-implemented events without interfering with the game.

## Planned tasks
- Find out how to exclude code from regular execution and run it in the editor.
- Find out how to identify the correct scene to run the code in.
- Combine discoveries to run code only in a specific (demo) scene.

The tasks are planned to be executed alone.

## Intended learning goal(s)
- Learning how to easily test/debug features that depend on other unimplemented features (events in this case).
- Learning how to limit code execution to a specific scenario (and prevent it from affecting release-code).

## Intended integration 
> (Note, the literal translation was something like "The transfer of" in regards to the team.)

### Within the team
N/A because the code should not affect any production/release state of the game and only a specific demo scene for internal use.

### Towards other teams
N/A because the code should not affect any production/release state of the game and only a specific demo scene for internal use.
