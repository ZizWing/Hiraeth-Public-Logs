Intended result 3 - Destructible Objects
==================

## Description of the result
For one of our levels we require trees to be destructible to a certain extent. Ideally a system can be created that supports destruction of any object.

## Planned tasks
- Research different implementations of destroyable objects.
- Build a prototype.
- Evaluate prototypes against visuals and time to realize.
- Determine optimal solution and start creating a first version.

## Intended learning goal(s)
- Learn how to destroy objects fast and efficiÃ«ntly in unity.
- Learn how to minimalize implementation impact on the art team.

## Intended integration 
> (Note, the literal translation was something like "The transfer of" in regards to the team.)

### Within the team
Prototypes are built on their own branches and in separate scenes so they won't affect anything outside it.

### Towards other teams
Nothing worth mentioning yet since this won't go beyond research and prototyping (yet).
