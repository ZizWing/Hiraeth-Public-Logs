# Logbook

# Week 1

## Monday
Maurice's statemachine was ready for use and thus I started to implement my firefly AI into the statemachine. Maurice taught me how the statemachine worked during the proces. Note: the logbook was not yet available on this day so a rough estimation of the time was made.

Started messing around with my own implementation of the particle system for fireflies. Initial results show a lot of promise.

## Friday
Further implemented particle system for fireflies. I'm now confident the entire behaviour can be implemented through a mix of the particle system and small scripts.

## Wednesday
A little over half the day I spent my time working on writing down my findings of the particle system. Once new potential tasks for the next sprint started becoming clear I spent some time on researching destructible objects for that.
