Achieved result 3
===================

## Description
No viable method of destroying objects without affecting the art team was found. The most minimalistic approach would be to use nothing but a particlesystem, which only requires a 2D particle to display. The more obvious option would be to replace an object with a destroyable variant and let physics do the work, but this is heavy on the art side of things. One final option I found was using a plane mesh to calculate an intersection of the polygons of a mesh and use it to split it up in 2 pieces. Then apply physics to both pieces and your object is destroyed. This last method will require some heft experimenting and fine-tuning to get it working correctly for complex shapes, something which may not be possible given the short time of the project.

Here is a gif of the final method in action, by using a unity package that turns a mesh into simple 3D triangles. The amount is not accurate to the volume of the original mesh, but the idea is waht matters here. This served as a functionality test for the method.

Note: The tree on the left is a tree generated by Unity and the tree on the right is a tree from the interactable vine door. The vine door tree has a lot more polygons which causes the current implementation to freak out and destroy the performance. This should be fixable, but this is worth taking into account.

The particle implementation is pretty much identical to a regular particle system emitting particles outwards, except it's initially starts in the shape of a given mesh. As such I did not make a gif of this.

> A functional but extremely performance heavy method of using objects to manipulate other objects. Commonly used in 3D editing software. Anything but basic shapes becomes a massive hit to performance, so this is not an options. Besides this, it would not support physics for individual parts that become disconnected.

> A discussion about slicing meshes in pieces. Very promising since it allows runtime creation of new meshes that are created from the original, each capable of becoming their own complete object. The asset store has few similar packages available, so performance is currently unclear. Based on what little info there is, it seems possible at runtime without too much issues. This would be the go-to method of destroying objects without affecting the art team, at the cost of implementing such a system.

## Achieved learning goal(s)
- Discovered multiple methods of destroying objects, including those with minimal impact on other teams.
- Learned how to implement a basic destroyable object through regular means by using a destroyed variant of an object.
- Obtained knowledge of dynamic object slicing, opening the possibility of implementing such a system in the future (assuming it works efficiently on complex meshes).

## Integration 
> (Note, the literal translation was something like "The transfer of" in regards to the team.)

### Within the team
Since it has not been decided yet how destroyable objects will be implemented, integration is a non-issue since the prototypes live on their own branch in git and only use their own demo scene. Once it is decided how to tackle this issue, integration will be looked at.

### Towards other teams
